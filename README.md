# pandas-challenge
In this challenge, I analyze two datasets containing information on schools. This information includes: Student ID,	student name,	gender,	grade,	school name,	reading score,	math score,	School ID,	type,	size and budget. Using this data, I make several observations on how some of these factors impact the the overall grades of students attending these schools.
